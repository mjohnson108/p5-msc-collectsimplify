Math::Symbolic::Custom::CollectSimplify
=======================================

Simplify Math::Symbolic expressions using Math::Symbolic::Custom::Collect

Redefines Math::Symbolic's "simplify()" method using the Math::Symbolic module extension class Math::Symbolic::Custom::Simplification. 
This new simplify() method uses "to_collected()" in Math::Symbolic::Custom::Collect. Because "to_collected()" doesn't always produce a 
simpler expression, this module uses a measure of expression complexity based on the number of constants, variables and operators to 
try to determine if the resultant expression is any simpler; if not it will return the expression passed to it.
